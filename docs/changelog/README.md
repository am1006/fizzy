# Fizzy Changelog

This folder contains weekly development activity summaries generated by the `fizzy-changelog-reviewer` agent.

## File Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern `YYYY-WXX.md` where:
- `YYYY` = ISO year
- `WXX` = ISO week number (01-53)

Example: `2026-W03.md` for week 3 of 2026.

## Purpose

These changelog entries serve as a progressive development log, helping developers:
- Catch up on what's been happening in the codebase
- Understand the narrative arc of ongoing features and refactoring
- Track "things to watch" across weeks
- Onboard new team members with historical context

Each entry connects to previous ones, forming a continuous story of Fizzy's evolution.
